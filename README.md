Simple login page. Based off Web Dev Simplified's tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RCnNyD0L-s&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8DWL14Wud_m8NeNNbYKOkj&index=6&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified).

The login uses passport, and bcrypt to encrypt the password when storing. I plan on changing the program to encrypt the password before it sends it to the server to make it more secure.
